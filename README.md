# CognitiveJS

CognitiveJS is a front-end framework/library, aims to make web development a bit easier by separating the content from the layout using data driven methods. It is stripped down from almost if not all preliminary actions and design patterns, additionally it has no dependencies making it a great choice for those who search for lightweight DOM manipulation tool with only *sprinkles* on top.

Cognitive loosely inspired by [Knockout](https://knockoutjs.com/) and deprecated version of [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).

See more information about it on [CognitiveJS Documentation](https://alperderman.github.io/CognitiveJS/docs/).
